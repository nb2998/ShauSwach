An android app to encourage sanitation in rural areas.

The application aims at improving the sanitation in rural areas by encouraging the use of public restrooms. Currently, it has 3 main modules to do that. One, the user has to scan the QR code placed on the restroom door which gives him/her reward points, thus encouraging him/her to use publc restrooms. As soon as the user does that he/she can review the quality of restrooms by simply pressing Yes Or No, thus giving rise to the second module-Leaderboard where all the restrooms will be given a ranking based on user reviews. This will motivate the concerned authorities to work better to achieve higher rank. Third module comprises of tutorials to further encourage use of public washrooms.All the instructions on each page in the application are recited in hindi voice to be easily understood by the user.

The application has a very simple easy-to-use UI and UX.
